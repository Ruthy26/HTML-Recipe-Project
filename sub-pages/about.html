            <q cite="https://artsandculture.google.com/story/6QUBPDixwYYcKA"> <strong>Okra Soup</strong></q>is one of the most common soups in Nigeria. It cuts across various tribes, particularly the Igbos and the Yoruba. Okra is a warm-season vegetable. Fresh okra pods are sold whole or grated there in the market to cut down cooking time.

            Okra is a green vegetable that is rich in protein, riboflavin, niacin, phosphorus, potassium, zinc and copper. It is also a good source of dietary fibre, vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin K, thiamin, vitamin B6, folate, calcium, magnesium and manganese. It is called Okra soup by the Igbos, Obe ila by the Yorubas and Otong soup by the Efik/Ibibio.
         <br/> <br/>
            It is a versatile dish that can be enjoyed with all kinds of swallow (eba, semovita, wheat, pounded yam and even eko, which is a type of corn meal).The Yorubas cook it plain, garnish it with different meats and serve it with tomatoes and pepper stew. The Igbos cook it with assorted meats and finish it off with palm oil and also add vegetables like ugu (pumpkin leaf), which gives it that brownish color. The Efik/Ibibio cook it in a similar way too.
